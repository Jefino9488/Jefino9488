        "introduction": "The Lost-in-the-Middle Analyzer is a comprehensive benchmarking framework for evaluating how large language models (LLMs) handle information distributed across long contexts. The system tests the hypothesis that LLMs exhibit a U-shaped performance curve where accuracy is higher for information at the beginning and end of contexts, but lower for information in the middle.",

                    "This analyzer generates synthetic datasets with embedded answers at controlled positions (start, middle, end), processes them through various retrieval and aggregation methods, and evaluates LLM accuracy as a function of answer position and document length.",
                    "The core insight being tested is that LLMs may struggle with retrieving information from the middle portions of long contexts, which has significant implications for RAG systems and document processing applications."
